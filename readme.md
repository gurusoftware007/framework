# Laravel 4 Beta Change Log

## Beta 2

- Migrated to ircmaxell's [password-compat](http://github.com/ircmaxell/password_compat) library for PHP 5.5 forward compatibility on hashes. No backward compatibility breaks.
- Inflector migrated to L4. Eloquent models now assume their table names if one is not specified. New helpers `str_plural` and `str_singular`.
- Improved `Route::controller` so that `URL::action` may be used with RESTful controllers.
